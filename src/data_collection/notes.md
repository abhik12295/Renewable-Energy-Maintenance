## Geospatial data is a broad category that includes data with geographic coordinates or spatial information. It can encompass various types of data, such as satellite imagery, maps, and location-based datasets.

### Use USGS USETDB - to get turbine location for wind turbine location with capacity_MW, plantcode
### using for computing site density(number of turbines/plants within 50km) to capture clusterin effects
### of maintenance and output.
### mapping texa wind solar sites in streamlit dashboard

## While OpenStreetMap data is type of geospatial data that can be used to get the location of assets. It is a specific source of geospatial data, providing crowd-sourced map data that includes information about roads, buildings, and other features. OpenStreetMap data can be used to extract the location of assets, such as wind turbines or solar panels, by querying the map for specific features or tags.

### Osm data - location of renrewable energy sites(wind, solar) in Texas with geometry, generator:source
### and name of the site
### complimenting USGS USETDB data - compute site densitu in preprocessing pipeline
